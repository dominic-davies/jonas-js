    <h2>Lecture 2.8 - Variables and data types</h2>
    <p>Primitive data types (non object)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Number: in js, always floating point, always have decimals even if you don't see them (or look like
            integers).</li>
        <li>String: text, a sequence of characters</li>
        <li>Boolean: Logical data type, can only be true or false.</li>
        <li>Undefined: gets automatically assigned to a var that has no value yet</li>
        <li>Null: 'non existent'</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>JS has dynamic typing.</h3>
    <p>Data types are automatically assigned to variables. you don't have to say what type it is js knows that "john" is
        a string and 28 is a number.</p>
    <h3>Variable names</h3>
    <p>Give variables meaningful names. Use camelCase notation. Can't start a var with a number.</p>
